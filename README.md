#### Change Log  

* MOD: Up to 20 Enemy Planets savable
* MOD: 20 Attack plans can be saved and executed

#### Known Bugs  

* (critical) All saved enemy planets and attack plans files are not combatible with this build
	[WORKAROUND]
	Delete in your user directory inside the folder oEPIC both files: 'EP.ini' and 'AttackPlans.ini' or
	open these files and copy past one section until there are 20 sections
* (critical) I'm not quite sure but I'm guessing it could cause some trouble to activate a plan with 'NULL'-values  
* (non-critical) Attack plan refresh buttons  
  + In some cases the settings are not correct  
* (non-critical) No refreshing for planet preview names after start up  
  + Transfer tab  
  + Attack tab  
* (non-critical) Debug browser offset values are working but in fact these are currently more useless than useful* Debug browser offset values are working but in fact these are currently more useless than usefull  

#### Upcoming

* (low / in dev) Sound feedback
  + If an attack is imminent
* Misc tab  
  + (low / planned) Auto check mails 'All Mails Readed'  
* Build tab  
  + (low / planned) Basic setup plans to build buildings  
* (medium / in dev) Debug check for login
